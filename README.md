The ASAR implementation likely isn't working because it may be fighting against S2VNet's core strengths rather than enhancing them. Here are the most probable issues and better alternatives:
Why ASAR Failed:

Attention conflict: Adding attention on top of S2VNet's existing spectral variability modeling may create competing optimization objectives
Feature dilution: Multi-scale processing might be diluting the carefully tuned subpixel information
Training instability: The feedback loop for endmember refinement could interfere with the established unmixing convergence



the S2VNet hyperspectral classification framework with a novel Adaptive Spectral-Spatial Attention Refinement module (S2VNet-ASAR) that preserves the existing codebase while significantly boosting accuracy.
Core Innovation Requirements:

Spectral Uncertainty-Aware Attention: Design a learnable attention mechanism that weights spectral bands based on their reliability for each pixel, accounting for atmospheric noise and sensor artifacts that S2VNet's current spectral variability modeling doesn't address.
Multi-Scale Subpixel Context Fusion: Create a hierarchical feature pyramid that operates on S2VNet's extracted abundances at multiple scales (3x3, 5x5, 7x7), enabling better capture of spatial context without losing subpixel precision.
Dynamic Endmember Refinement: Implement a feedback loop where classification confidence scores adaptively refine endmember estimates during inference, creating a self-improving system.

Technical Constraints:

Must integrate as a plug-in module to existing S2VNet architecture
Preserve all existing loss functions and training procedures
Add <5% computational overhead
Maintain compatibility with existing datasets and evaluation protocols
